## üîÑ **SAFE DEVELOPMENT WORKFLOW**

### 1. **Before Making Changes**
```bash
# Create backup tag
python safe_git_helper.py
# Choose option 4: Create backup tag
```

### 2. **During Development**
```bash
# Regular health checks
python system_health_check.py

# Test changes immediately
python ollama_interface_fixed.py
```

### 3. **After Changes**
```bash
# Complete workflow
python safe_git_helper.py  
# Choose option 7: Complete safe workflow
```

## üéØ **RECOMMENDED DEVELOPMENT ORDER**

### 1. **High Impact, Low Risk**
- Improve visual feedback and status indicators
- Add more keyboard shortcuts
- Enhance error messages
- Optimize performance settings

### 2. **Medium Impact, Medium Risk**  
- Add new speech recognition features
- Improve window targeting algorithms
- Expand AI vision capabilities
- Add configuration options

### 3. **High Impact, High Risk**
- Implement browser automation
- Add plugin architecture
- Cloud service integrations
- Major UI redesigns

---

## üìû **SUPPORT & DEBUGGING**

### If Something Breaks
1. Run `python system_health_check.py`
2. Check the specific error messages
3. Restore from latest backup tag if needed
4. Use `safe_git_helper.py` for safe Git operations

### Common Issues & Solutions
- **Import errors**: Check `requirements.txt` and install missing packages
- **CUDA issues**: Verify torch installation and GPU drivers
- **Window targeting fails**: Refresh window list and verify target app
- **Speech recognition not working**: Check microphone permissions
